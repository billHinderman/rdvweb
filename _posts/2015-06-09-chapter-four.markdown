Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language. It describes the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language. For the time being, we’ll limit the markup we’re talking about to HTML, but later on you will dig into using CSS to style scalable vector graphics (SVGs).

CSS is designed to separate the content of a document from the document’s presentation. (Sound familiar?) It is the box in which you contain all of your design; and in the progressive enhancement tower, it sits on top of the content.

This wasn’t always the case, though. Looking back at the first website, all that existed was plain text with no decoration, large headings, and underlined links in blue.

As the first decade of the web unfolded, HTML evolved to contain a wider variety of both semantic and stylistic elements. The issue that arose, however, was that there was absolutely nothing stopping web designers from using one to achieve the goals of the other. That is, although web design has become more robust, it was achieved at the cost of much more complex and inaccessible HTML.

By 1994, the web community had developed a keen interest in improving the presentation capabilities of browsers. At that point, nine different implementations of stylesheet languages had been proposed on the www-style mailing list. Of those nine, two became actually influential to what we call CSS today: Cascading HTML Style Sheets (CHSS) and the Stream-based Style Sheet Proposal (SSP).

The CSS Level 1 Recommendation was published by the W3C by the end of 1996. Until this point, development of HTML, CSS, and the DOM had been taken on entirely by the HTML Editorial Review Board (ERB). In early 1997, the ERB was split into three groups tasked with specific projects: the HTML working group, the DOM working group, and the CSS working group.

Not wasting any time, the CSS working group began tackling holes in the CSS Level 1 Recommendation, resulting in the creatively named CSS Level 2 Recommendation in November 1997. This recommendation was published by the W3C on May 12, 1998.

CSS Level 3, which was started in 1998, remains in development to this day. Although browsers regularly implement “proposed” CSS3 features, the spec has not been ratified to the point where it can serve as a definitive W3C recommendation.

Of the more than 50 modules that are part of CSS Level 3, four have been adopted as recommendations: color, selectors level 3, namespaces, and media queries.

That means the current web design landscape is such that most basic rules are implemented uniformly by browsers, while others cannot be counted on.
