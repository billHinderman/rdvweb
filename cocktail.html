<p>The Cocktail Guide is a project referenced throughout  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1119067146/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1119067146&linkCode=as2&tag=billhind-20&linkId=BXDNUXNJYHFNFWYL" rel="external" title="Order Building Responsive Data Visualization for the Web on Amazon.com" class="link">Building Responsive Data Visualization for the Web</a>. Within the book, the project spans a search results page for a list of cocktail recipes, and the recipe pages themselves.</p>

<p>The search results page is used to illustrate responsive web design, while the recipe page is used to illustrate responsive data visualization within a responsive webpage.</p>

<p>The actual website can be found at <a rel="external" class="link" href="http://thecocktailgui.de" target="_blank">thecocktailgui.de</a>, though it is a number of years old and uses readically different coding conventions than those in the book.  For design's sake, however, it is identical.</p>

<p>The code used and referenced in the book can be found <a href="https://github.com/starbaseGo/responsivedatavisualization/tree/master/resources/cocktail" target="_blank" class="link">in the github repository</a>.
