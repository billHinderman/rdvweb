<h2 class="chapter-title">The Gist</h2>
<p>The Train Tracker is a project referenced throughout the second part of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1119067146/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1119067146&linkCode=as2&tag=billhind-20&linkId=BXDNUXNJYHFNFWYL" rel="external" title="Order Building Responsive Data Visualization for the Web on Amazon.com" class="link">Building Responsive Data Visualization for the Web</a>. In the book, the project is used to illustrate the following concepts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Progressive enhancement.</li>
  <li>Building a clean API.</li>
  <li>Handling AJAX loading.</li>
  <li>Responsive data visualization.</li>
</ul>

<p>The actual website can be found at <a rel="external" class="link" href="http://cta.billhinderman.com" target="_blank">cta.billhinderman.com</a>.  That is a Backbone.js project, and its implementation details are obfuscated.  However, its design is identical to that in the book, and can be used as a jumping-off point for discussion on design, rather than the canonical reference for implementation details.</p>

<p>The code used and referenced in the book can be found <a href="https://github.com/starbaseGo/responsivedatavisualization/tree/master/resources/train" target="_blank" class="link">in the github repository</a>.</p>
